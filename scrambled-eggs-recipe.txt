Ingredients:
- Eggs	
- 3 Butter	
- 1.5 Tablespoons Creme Fraiche (I use cheese spread instead)	
- 1 Tablespoon Salt	
- 1 Tablespoon Pepper	
- Chives

Directions:
1. Add eggs and butter in a saucepan and stir with a spatula on low heat. 
2. Take pan off the stove, stirring continuously all the while. This prevents overcooking.   Gotta hate those spongy dry scrambled eggs. 
3. Put back on the heat. Never stop stirring. That's the trick 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you achieve a creamy consistency. Not too runny, but not dry by any means. 
5. Turn heat off. Stir in creme fraiche (or cheese spread), salt, pepper and chives.
6. Serve on toast. It's even better if you serve it on toast that's topped with bruschetta.
